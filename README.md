# ðŸ“š MySQL Journey: Learning Relational Databases with XAMPP

Welcome to my MySQL learning journey! ðŸš€  
This repository documents what I've learned through a short course on MySQL using **XAMPP** as the local server environment. It's a personal archive of exercises, queries, and insights into relational database management and SQL syntax.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **XAMPP** â€“ for local server and database setup (Apache + MySQL)
- **phpMyAdmin** â€“ for database management via a web interface
- **SQL** â€“ to perform all database operations

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
### âœ… Basics of Relational Databases
- Understanding tables, records, primary keys, and relationships
- Database design principles (Normalization, Foreign Keys)

### âœ… Core SQL Syntax
- `CREATE`, `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
- Filtering with `WHERE`, sorting with `ORDER BY`
- Pattern matching with `LIKE`, wildcard searches
- Table joins: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`

### âœ… Practical Experience
- Designing and populating sample databases
- Querying data using real-world scenarios
- Using phpMyAdmin to manage and visualize database structure

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
/sql-practice/ â†’ SQL query files from my practice
/sample-databases/ â†’ Exported .sql files from phpMyAdmin
/notes/ â†’ Personal notes and cheatsheets

## ðŸŒŸ Highlights
- Learned how to use **phpMyAdmin** to visualize and manage MySQL databases
- Built sample relational databases (e.g., student records, product inventory)
- Practiced JOINs and complex queries for real-world applications

## ðŸ”— Related Topics I'm Exploring Next
- PHP + MySQL (connecting databases to web apps)
- Stored Procedures & Triggers
- Database normalization in depth
